<h2>Access to this API is controlled by AWS resource policies</h2>

<h3>AWS Resource Policies</h3>

<p>
    Amazon API Gateway resource policies are JSON policy documents that are attached to an API to control whether a
    specified principal (typically an IAM user or role) can invoke the API. API Gateway resource policies can be used
    to allow an API to be securely invoked by: 
    <ul>
        <li>Users from a specified AWS account.</li>
        <li>Specified source IP address ranges or CIDR blocks.</li>
        <li>Specified virtual private clouds (VPCs) or VPC endpoints (in any account).</li>
    </ul>
</p>
