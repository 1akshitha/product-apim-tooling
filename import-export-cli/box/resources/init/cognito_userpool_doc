<h2>This API is secured using a AWS cognito userpool</h2>

<h3>Cognito userpool</h3>

<p>
    To call any API methods with a user pool enabled, API clients must perform the following tasks: 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use the Amazon Cognito CLI/SDK or API to sign a user in to the chosen user pool, and obtain an identity token or access token.</li>
    <li>Use a client-specific framework to call the deployed API Gateway API and supply the appropriate token in the Authorization header.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The API developer must provide the client developers with the user pool ID, a client ID, and possibly the associated client secrets that are defined as part of the user pool. 
    Format of a well known URL of an AWS cognito userpool : https://cognito-idp.[region].amazonaws.com/[userpool-id]/.well-known/openid-configuration
